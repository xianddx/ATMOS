        <p>We are an interdisciplinary research team committed to establishing an intelligent classroom through AI technology. Our aim is to assist teachers in improving their teaching methods based on data and adapting to the new requirements of teaching abilities in the new era. We lead the exploration and practice of educational reform in the era of artificial intelligence. Our research work covers disciplines such as education, psychology, computer science, and artificial intelligence. The project includes the construction of theoretical models, the design of intelligent classrooms, and the development of software platforms based on machine learning. We aim to build a high-level AI teaching infrastructure in the classroom through the AI-Powered Teaching Methodology Optimization System (ATMOS) and help teachers explore new teaching methods brought by AI technology in higher education.</p>
